            <h3>Film deviates from the book</h3>
            <p>Film is not a book, you can't read characters' thoughts, you can only watch and hear from outside.
                This forces film directors to improvise with the ways they portray the plot.
                (It's a hard pill to swallow, when you watch the film after reading books)
                (the picture stretch is an artistic choise)

            <h3>Bald dudes</h3>
            <p> I do not know why film directors made them look cartoonishly evil.
                They weren't like that in the book
